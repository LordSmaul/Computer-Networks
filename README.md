# Computer-Networks

This folder contains all the programming assignments from my Computer Networks class. All of these programs were tested locally and deal with handling packets and transfering them in different ways across a network. VMs were also provided through GCM for us to test our code by sending packets between two VMs
___
**Here is a breakdown of each program and their purpose. All relevant documentation is included in each file.**

Program 1: Basic introduction to network packet hadling

Program 2: Simple protocol - sending packets with instructions to simulate blinking an LED. Message logging was done for each interaction.

Program 3: Design and implement a client-server system using Raspberry Pi devices. The server controls an LED, while the client will sense motion using a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) and communicate with the server to blink the LED. The assignment included establishing a three-way handshake (through a UDP protocol), sending blink duration and count information, acknowledging the data, and responding to motion detection by blinking the LED. Message logging was done for each interaction.
